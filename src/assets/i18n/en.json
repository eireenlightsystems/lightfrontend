The system can be used in populated\n  points on the test sites. Control and management of lighting is carried out as part of a single automated system, which includes following items: lamps with adjustable luminous flux; a participant monitoring subsystem; luminaire mode control subsystem; subsystem monitoring the level of natural light; dispatch center.",
